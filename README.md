# E-Commerce

## Description
For this challenge we were asked to finish code for an e-commerce back end, this project was partially done, all I had to do was add code for the models and routes folders. 

## Installation
First thing I did to finish this challenge was set up the dotenv file to store mysql information, and import sequelize into the server.js file. Once that was finished I went on to the models folder and made sure all the they were set up the way the acceptance criteria maps it out. Lastly I worked on the routes api, this got a little confusing but it help a lot to look back on the mini project, I would say working on this particular challenge felt a little simpler than the other for me personally which made me feel quite confident since the coarse has been quit challenging thus far, the only thing I had to keep looking back in the student activities for was just to make sure I had the correct syntax.

## Usage
Using Thunderclient or insomnia, users can Get, Post, Put, and Delete data from the database using the correct routes.
